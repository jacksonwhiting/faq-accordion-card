## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View and hide questions in an accordion format

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javscript

### What I learned

The biggest challenge was laying out the three SVGs on top of each other in the desktop version while clipping the SVG with the Woman and allowing the box to protrude outside the container.

### Continued development

If I had more time I would smooth out the entry and exit of the answers when clicking on the questions.  I would do this using transform/translate or a CSS animation.
